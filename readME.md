# VirtualShowrooms

Welcome to Virtual Showrooms, an application with two main components, that provides practical functionality, while injecting fun factors. This app will have Lidar-scanning features available that has the ability to convert scanned surfaces into augmented reality models (using .obj format) that can be displayed locally in the app. Essentially you are creating your own virtual showroom of objects. 

The other component involves real-time image classifications for objects (I'm focusing on car models for this application). TensorFlow will be used to train the models as TensorFlow Lite models are optimized for mobile performance. 

Project start date: 5.17.23
