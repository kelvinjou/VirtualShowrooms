# VirtualShowrooms

Welcome to Virtual Showrooms, an application that provides practical functionality, while injecting fun factors. This app has LiDAR-scanning features available that has the ability to convert scanned surfaces into augmented reality models (using .obj format) that can be displayed locally in the app. Essentially you are creating your own virtual showroom of objects.
